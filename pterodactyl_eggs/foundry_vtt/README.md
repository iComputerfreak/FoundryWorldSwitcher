The pterodactyl egg is originally from [https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs/tree/master/game_eggs/FoundryVTT](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs/tree/master/game_eggs/FoundryVTT).  
The pelican egg is originally from [https://github.com/pelican-eggs/games-standalone/tree/main/foundry_vtt](https://github.com/pelican-eggs/games-standalone/tree/main/foundry_vtt).

I modified them to include a variable for the world name to start the server with.
